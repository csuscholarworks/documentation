### Open Access
There are two dominant access models for scholarly journals: subscription-based and open access. To receive support from your CSU library, your journal must be committed to an open access model, which [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/open-access/) defines as “the free, immediate, online availability of research articles combined with the rights to use these articles fully in the digital environment.”

In addition to selecting your journal’s access model under Distribution Settings, you should also clearly state your journal’s open access policy, generally in the About the Journal section of the [Journal Settings](setting1.md).
