## DOIs

A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is an alphanumeric string assigned to online content to provide persistent access via an active web link. DOIs are primarily used in academic contexts and can be assigned at a high level (e.g., books, journals) and more granularly (e.g., articles, data sets, cover art).

DOIs have been in use for over twenty years, and there are a number of registration organizations, with [CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org/) and [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) being two of the most prominent. These identifiers are important for ensuring that digital content remains accessible and discoverable even when URLs change or content is migrated.

While some CSU libraries have subscriptions to a DOI registration agency, not all do yet. Please check with your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) to learn more about whether this service is part of the publishing program at your library.
