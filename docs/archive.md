## Archiving Your Journal
It is very important to identify an archiving (also known as digital preservation) strategy for your journal to ensure long-term access to the content.

As stated in the [Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing](https://doaj.org/bestpractice):

> A journal's plan for electronic backup and preservation of access to the journal
> content (for example, access to main articles via CLOCKSS or PubMedCentral) in the
> event a journal is no longer published shall be clearly indicated.

### PKP Private LOCKSS Network
All OJS journals that have an ISSN and have published at least one article are eligible to participate in the [PKP Private LOCKSS Network](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2016/08/08/pkp-lockss-pln-update/) (PLN) at no cost. The CSU libraries strongly recommend that journals take advantage of this opportunity and contact your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) for more information.

The [LOCKSS](https://www.lockss.org/) (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) Program was launched by Stanford Libraries in 1999, and it relies on open source software to provide digital preservation support to more than 1,000 publishers.

Do not enable archiving under Website Settings unless your journal or institution has a separate agreement with LOCKSS or CLOCKSS. Check with your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) if you have questions or concerns.
