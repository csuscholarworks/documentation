## DOIs
As of Summer 2020, Systemwide Digital Library Services became a member of Crossref and earmarked one-time funding for DOI registration. If your library is not a [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/fees/) or [DataCite](https://datacite.org/pricelist.html) member and/or does not have the funds to register DOIs, contact the director of Systemwide Digital Library Services for more information about the support available.

Once you have confirmed your ability to register DOIs on behalf of CSU journals, consult the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/doi-plugin/en/) and the [Crossref | OJS 3.1.2+ Manual](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref-ojs-manual/en/) for additional information.
