## Managing Your Journal
The OJS [editorial workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow) consists of four stages: Submission, Review, Copyediting, and Production. Once you log in, any [tasks](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#tasks) assigned to you will be flagged in the upper toolbar.

The following information pertains mainly to journal managers. Separate information for authors and reviewers is available at the following links:

- https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/authoring
- https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/reviewing

### Production
The [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#production) includes information related to formatting content for publication, including how to assign a Layout Editor. Additionally, the documentation includes information and guidance on [file formats](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#deciding-on-article-file-formats), noting that PDF and HTML are the most common formats used by journals.     

As previously noted, creating templates for your journal content is recommended to help address formatting and accessibility issues.
