### Copyediting
CSU libraries are unable to provide copyediting support for online journals. Many smaller-scale presses and individual open access journals rely on volunteers to do light copyediting or hire [freelance editors](https://www.the-efa.org/hiring/) to perform this work.

For detailed instructions on copyediting in OJS, see the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs-2/en/in_editing_copyediting).

To learn about the practices of copyediting, proofreading, and substantive editing, see this [article](https://www.editage.com/all-about-publication/english-editing/copy-editing-vs-proofreading-vs-substantive-editing.html).

It is also advisable to create a style guide for your journal to achieve consistency in style, grammar, and presentation, among other concerns. For examples of style guides, see *[The BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/house-style)* and *[The Journal of Politics](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/jop/style?mobileUi=0&)*.
