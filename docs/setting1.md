Your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) will work with the CSU’s Systemwide Digital Library Services to create an OJS account for your journal. Once that process is complete, you should familiarize yourself with the platform. The PKP’s [introduction](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/introduction#ojs-features) to OJS provides a brief overview of the various features.

## Journal Settings
To start adding information about your journal, click Settings in the left sidebar and select Journal. You can then follow along with the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/journal-setup) to add information for the Masthead, Contacts, Sections, and Categories.

Note that you will need to [apply for an ISSN](identifiers.md) for your journal.

Before describing your journal policies under About the Journal text box, please consult the [Establishing Policies](establish2.md) section of this guide.

Note that you can provide more detailed peer review policies pertaining to particular types of submissions under the Sections tab. For example, you may determine that certain types of submission will only undergo editorial review.
