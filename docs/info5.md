## ORCID Plugin
If your institution is an ORCID member, you can work with the director of [Systemwide Digital Library Services](https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/administration/sdls/Pages/about-us.aspx) to enable and configure the [ORCID plugin](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/orcid/en/installation-setup#enable-and-configure-the-orcid-profile-plugin-in-ojs). Note that this process will require entering your ORCID API.
