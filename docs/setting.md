Your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) will work with the CSU’s Systemwide Digital Library Services to create an OJS account for your journal. Once that process is complete, you should familiarize yourself with the platform. The PKP’s [introduction](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/introduction#ojs-features) to OJS provides a brief overview of the various features.

## User Roles
Those with Journal Manager accounts will be able to create and manage all user accounts for the journal. To view the current list of users, click Users & Roles in the left sidebar.

Please see the PKP documentation for more information about [user accounts](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/user-accounts) and the various [user roles](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/users-and-roles) in OJS.
