### Production
The [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#production) includes information related to formatting content for publication, including how to assign a Layout Editor. Additionally, the documentation includes information and guidance on [file formats](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#deciding-on-article-file-formats), noting that PDF and HTML are the most common formats used by journals.     

As previously noted, creating [templates](info2.md) for your journal content is recommended to help address formatting and accessibility issues.
