## ISSN
Applying for an ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) for your journal is an important step for discoverability and identification purposes.

You can apply for an ISSN for free through the [U.S. ISSN Center](http://www.loc.gov/issn/), and further instructions as well as the application form are available at the following link: https://www.loc.gov/issn/basics/basics-brochure-serials.html. Note that a separate ISSN is needed for online and print versions, if applicable.

Once you receive the ISSN for your journal, you should add it to the [masthead metadata](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/journal-setup#masthead) as well as the footer in OJS.
