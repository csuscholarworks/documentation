## Managing Your Journal

The OJS [editorial workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow) consists of four stages: Submission, Review, Copyediting, and Production. Once you log in, any [tasks](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#tasks) assigned to you will be flagged in the upper toolbar.

The following information pertains mainly to journal managers. Separate information for authors and reviewers is available at the following links:

- https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/authoring
- https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/reviewing

### Submission
This section of the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#submission-notifications) includes a review of email notifications related to submissions and information about the Submission Dashboard. As a journal manager, when you log into OJS, you should immediately see those submissions assigned to you. The other tabs allow you to browse additional submissions, and you can search for submissions as well.

Also note the information about the Submission Library. If you decide to add author agreements to your [Publisher Library](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/settings-workflow#publisher-library), authors can access the file by going to the Submission Library and clicking “View Document Library.” For further guidance on author agreements, see the following examples.
