## Workflow Settings
Next, click Settings in the left sidebar, and select Workflow. The corresponding [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-workflow) will guide you through this part of the setup process.

### Checklist
Iâ€™m working on a sample checklist. Some OJS journals use the checklist in lieu of an author agreement.

### Author Guidelines
Include links to some best practices?

### Review
Include some information about peer review here, rather than under policies?

Emphasize that journals do not have to use the OJS review form. Reviewers can also be instructed to simply upload their reviewer reports.

### Publisher Library
Should we recommend that journals store the author agreement here? What about other documents? https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-workflow#publisher-library
