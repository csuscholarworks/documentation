## Journal Settings

To start adding information about your journal, click Settings in the left sidebar and select Journal. You can then follow along with the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/journal-setup) to add information for the Masthead, Contacts, Sections, and Categories.

Note that you will need to apply for an ISSN for your journal.

Before describing your review policies for each section, please consult the Peer Review section of this guide. Depending on the types of content your journal will publish, you may decide that certain sections will only undergo editorial review.
