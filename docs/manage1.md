## Managing Your Journal
The OJS [editorial workflow](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow) consists of four stages: Submission, Review, Copyediting, and Production. Once you log in, any [tasks](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/editorial-workflow#tasks) assigned to you will be flagged in the upper toolbar.

The following information pertains mainly to journal managers. Separate information for authors and reviewers is available at the following links:

- https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/authoring
- https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/reviewing

### Review
As noted previously in this [guide](setting3.md), you can choose from various review options within the Workflow Settings. For more detailed instructions, review the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/settings-workflow#review).
