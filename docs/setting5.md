## Import Tool
If your journal already exists on another platform or in print and you need to migrate the content, consult the [Data Import and Export](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) section of the PKP Administratorâ€™s Guide. The PKP also has [more specific information](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2017/12/07/migrating-bepress-digital-commons-journals-to-ojs/) related to migrating journals from bepress Digital Commons to OJS.

If you require a plugin that is not already available, please email your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) for assistance.
