Your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) will work with the CSU’s Systemwide Digital Library Services to create an OJS account for your journal. Once that process is complete, you should familiarize yourself with the platform. The PKP’s [introduction](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/introduction#ojs-features) to OJS provides a brief overview of the various features.

## Import Tool
If your journal already exists on another platform or in print and you need to migrate the content, consult the [Data Import and Export](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) section of the PKP Administrator’s Guide. If you require a plugin that is not already available, please email your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) for assistance.
