## CSU Library Support

A growing number of CSU libraries support student and faculty journals, and this site is intended to serve as a central location for information regarding journal publishing best practices. Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout of the guide as well as the different types of information included. At this time, not all CSU libraries are able to provide the same level of support, so please check with your ***[library publishing contact](contacts.md)*** to learn more about what services may be available for your journal.

This guide is primarily intended for journals that are or will be hosted on the [CSU Open Journals site](https://journals.calstate.edu), which is supported by the CSU Chancellor Officeâ€™s Systemwide Digital Library Services and uses the open source [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) (OJS) software. OJS was developed by the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca) (PKP) in 2001, and [thousands of journals](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ojs-usage/ojs-stats/) around the world now use the software.

The PKP maintains extensive [OJS documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/3.1/en/) as well as free, self-paced courses on publishing through [PKP School](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca). This guide will both refer to and supplement PKP documentation and training materials.
