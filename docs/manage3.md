## Managing Your Journal
The OJS Workflow consists of four stages: Submission, Review, Copyediting, and Production.

## Production
Ideally, journal content should be published in at least three formats: PDFs (for your readers to download), HTMLs (for your readers to access online), and [JATS XMLs](https://blog.typeset.io/jats-xml-everything-a-publisher-needs-to-know-95862a4184a3#51cd) (to improve search engine visibility). Converting files into these various formats can be time-consuming, and depending on your journalâ€™s number of editorial staff and their technical expertise, you may or may not be able to support all of them. At this time, the CSU libraries are only able to provide consultative support, but the following information will assist you in getting started.

The [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/production-publication#format-article-for-publication) includes some information related to formatting content for publication, including how to assign a Layout Editor.  

Word templates? (Here is a useful video on how to format a word doc in journal format, though we should make our own, if not the template itself): https://youtu.be/rCQFEzHjV7I)
