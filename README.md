Just a website generator using Markdown (Docusaurus), currently used for the CSU OJS documentation site

## Getting Started
After making changes to template files in `/docs`, navigate to `/website` and run the test site:

`yarn run start` or `npm run start`

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

Once you're happy with the site, navigate to `/website` and run the generator:

`yarn run build` or `npm run build`

That's it! The site is located in the `/build` directory
