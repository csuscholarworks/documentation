## Establishing Policies
This section provides an overview of more theoretical publishing best practices, with a focus on publishing ethics, open access, peer review, copyright and licensing, and accessibility. Particularly if you are new to journal publishing, please take the time to familiarize yourself with this information, and email your [library publishing contact](contacts.md) if you have questions.

### Publishing Ethics
To engage in ethical publishing is to commit to an ongoing practice of transparency and fairness from the founding of a journal through its management, publication, distribution and preservation. The way in which ethics informs the publication process varies and includes, but is not limited to, the composition of editorial boards; the creation of policies that are transparent, clear, and inclusive; the identification and acknowledgement of bias, and the eradication of racist practices in all stages of the publication process; an adherence to principles of academic integrity; and clearly defined and fairly administered peer-review processes. In the CSU OJS ecosystem, ethical publishing includes a commitment to ensuring that publications are free and openly available.
