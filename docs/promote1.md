## Social Media
OJS also allows integration of social media buttons onto a journal’s sidebar by using the AddThis plugin. Go to Settings > Website > Plugins > Plugin Gallery to find and activate the AddThis plugin. You will need an AddThis [account](https://www.addthis.com/) to activate statistics. See the [PKP documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#plugins) for further instructions.

If you are new to social media for journal promotion, here is a useful [article](https://blog.typeset.io/how-to-use-social-media-to-promote-your-journal-86137c71fd52) on promoting across different social media platforms. SAGE Publishing also has an in-depth guide to [promoting your journal](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/promote-your-journal) with social media.

There is a growing body of research on the effectiveness of promoting academic research through social media. For example:
 - “Using social media to promote academic research: Identifying the benefits of twitter for sharing academic work”: 2020: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229446
 - “Social Media and the 21st-Century Scholar: How You Can Harness Social Media to Amplify Your Career” (2017): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2017.09.025
